# GANN

[[Basic example]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Turing-IA-IHC/gann/blob/master/notebooks/test_darwin_g0.ipynb)

Genetic Algorithm + Neural Networks

## Approach

This library allows you to apply evolution to neural networks to achieve better results.

## Setup

We used Python 3.10+ command:

    # coming soon
    pip install -U gann

Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Turing-IA-IHC/gann.git 

To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run:

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/Turing-IA-IHC/gann.git

### With GPU

If your computer has GPU card you are able to use cupy library. To install cupy go to https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html
